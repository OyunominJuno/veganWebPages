    <h3> Tofu Banh-Mi (time required - 10 mins!)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Tofu - deep or side fried</li>
        <li>Soy protein slices (optional)</li>
        <li>Banh-Mi or any sandwich bread like in the picture</li>
        <li>Cucumber</li>
        <li>Pickled daikon and carrot</li>
        <li>Cilantro</li>
        <li>Jalapeno - if you would like it spicy</li>
        <li>Vegetarian barbeque sauce - 2 table spoon</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Grab your tofu and the soy protein and put them in a small pan. Add your any flavor of barbeque sauce and half-cup water. Boil the tofu and protein in middle fire until water and sauce get into the tofu. <br>Cut your bread as shown in the picture. <br>Put your tofu and protein inside the bread as well as listed vegatables. <br> Can you believe it? It is ready!</p>
    <p>Ps: This easy cooking tip is for all who are in a hurry or in a lazy mode. Easy and quick. Important part is boiling tofu and protein in the sauce because most people use just fried tofus which does not have flavor we want in our sandwich. Exclude anything you want. Enjoy!</p>

    <h3> Veggie Soup (time required - 40 mins)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Jicama (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1AVFC_enUS795US795&q=jicama&spell=1&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjX4Nj07szbAhWRLnwKHceVD3cQBQgmKAA&biw=1280&bih=590">Here</a> if you ever heard)</li>
        <li>Cabbage</li>
        <li>Broccoli</li>
        <li>Root vegetable</li>
        <li>Daikon</li>
        <li>Cane sugar</li>
        <li>Mushroom extract powder</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Don't throw away any hard of the vegetables. Keep your broccoli or cauliflower bottom, white and hard part of all kind of the cabbages. Keep it refrigerated. When you want a soup that lasts longer freshly, wash and chop (any shape but similar sizes) your vegetable remains and some roots veggies such as daikon, jicama and japanese root vegetable as listed in the ingredients. Boil the root vegetables for 25 mins, add rest of the veggies and boil again for 15 more mins. Take out all the vegetables (you can finally throw it away) and add some salt, mushroom extract and little bit of cane sugar. That is it.</p>
    <p>Ps: Basically we are taking vitamins from the unused part of the vegetables we throw away and making soup out of it. Adding root vegetables makes it vitamin rich but also saves our soup from becoming watery and tasteless. You can keep your soup up to 4 days and whenever you want add anything you want like fried tofu, soft tofu, noodles, rices and green leafy veggies.</p>
