            <h3>What is Vegan?</h3>
            <p>Vegan is a lifestyle rather than a diet that doesn't consume anything derived from animal. Vegans refrain from eating dairies, wearing furs and buying animal tested or derived products. But this doesn't mean you have to say no to your favorite chickens and cheeses. Today there are all kind of yummy substitutes such as chicken, fish, egg, beef and pork that is made by textured soy protein, cheese, yogurt, milk beverages and creamers all made by bean or nut milk. So you can still have your favorite pizza with mozzaralla cheese and barbeque with friends. Just now what different is environment-friendly, easy digesting, less calories and smarter source for all of your food. Also, vegetables and bean proteins are easy and very quick to cook. <a href="recipes.html">See more...</a></p>

            <h3>Why vegan is important?</h3>
            <p>Veganism is an excellent solution for the planet warming because plant-based food preparation uses much less water and releases less carbon-monoxide to the air. Starvation of the half of the human population can be stopped veganism. Logic is simple. Gradually starts feed the people by agricultural products instead of feeding animals to get their meat and milk. So starvation problem will be fixed eventually. Wondering what will happen to animals? If we go vegan that means artificial and forced reproduction of animals will stop. Then earth will regain it's balance on animals, so nobody will massively die. Stopping slaughterhouse and meat-producing will cause less harm for the planet! <a href="facts.html">See more...</a></p>

            <h3>How is vegan life?</h3>
            <p>Being vegan is not expensive and hard! People think green vegetables are expensive and hard to keep them. But from the other perspective, it is easy to cook so you can eat fresh food each time you cook. No more frozen and canned food! And financially speaking, money that you spent on meat and frozen processed food will just now go the freshly harvested vegetables and protein. So not very big difference on grocery bill. Your cooking style will change, so in the long run, you might even notice less spending on your food and energy consumption. A lot of inner and outer aspect of your body will start to change. <a href="changes.html">See more...</a></p>
